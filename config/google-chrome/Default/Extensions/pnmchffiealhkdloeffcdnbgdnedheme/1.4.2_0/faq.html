            <p class="label">Where is the extension's database stored?</p>
            <p>
                The database is located in a subfolder in your Chrome profile directory. To find your Chrome profile directory, go to the "chrome://version/" URL and look for "Profile Path". Go to that directory, and then open the "databases" folder, followed by the "chrome-extension_pnmchffiealhkdloeffcdnbgdnedheme_0" folder. The database will be there. The name of the file is a number (e.g., "16"); the contents of the file is a SQLite database.

            <p class="label">Does history sync automatically? If so, how often?</p>
            <p>
                Yes, history is synced automatically. It happens each time Chrome starts up, as well as when you open the "Trends" or "Search" pages in the extension.
            </p>
            <p class="label">How do I remove all data from the extension?</p>
            <p>
                The quickest and easiest way is to uninstall the extension.
            </p>
            <p class="label">Does this extension preserve the purple color of previously clicked links?</p>
            <p>
                Since this extension stores its data separately from Chrome's history, it will not preserve the color of visited links.
