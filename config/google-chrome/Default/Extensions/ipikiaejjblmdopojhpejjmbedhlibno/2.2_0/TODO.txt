TODO:
 - see history on pause? like sprint reader
 	- how to make this less distracting? e.g. where to put it. this isn't a crucial feature yet...

 - overlay time estimate
 	- screwing up on google docs, it's displaying multiple times... only sometimes though?

 - window sizing issue in windows
 	- on context menu
 		- default 800, 500
 	- yet onload window iw: 790, ih: 472... weird
 	- resized to: 768, 426
 		- window opens to 758, 398
